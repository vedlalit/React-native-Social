# React-native-Social

Please don't include index.js in your expo project vice versa for React-native project.

Will try to update code frequently and will make it more robust.

Do install all the modules/dependencies required:
  ( follow the official documentation just google the following: )
      
      npm / yarn ( I suggest Yarn over npm)
      React navigation 
      React native elements
      React native Vector icons
      React native Firebase
